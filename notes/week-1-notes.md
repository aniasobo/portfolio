## Debugging workshop

**Types of bug**

- syntax error
- gem not installed
- method/no method error/name error (trying to call an undefined/uninitialised object)
- incorrect logic when using/testing the program
- name errors

**Debug process**

1. Reproduce the bug
2. Read the error message(s)
3. Refer to the spec/user story/user need to identify what code is expected to do 
4. Print everything to tighten the loop/look into the steps of the program (p/print/puts); print around the line causing the problem; print a marker string around/before the problem line (for name errors); print numbered strings for step-by-step printing of problem lines
