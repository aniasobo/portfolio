- [ ] Dealing with Broken Bikes
- [ ] Isolating Tests with Doubles
- [ ] Mocking Behaviour on Doubles
- [ ] Men with Ven
- [ ] Modules as Mixins


### Things we learned:
- GitHub collaboration with both collaborators committing changes (driver initialised & added remote, navigator updates the tracking note & process notes)
- structure of user story
- stack trace -> list of method calls that the program was in the middle of when an Exception was thrown
- initialising the object in irb, as a nil object, solves the uninitialised constant error
- initialising rspec - added lib directory manually, added the first test file in the spec directory, ran rspec to confirm all is green/setup was successful 
- Rspec - use the 'subject' keyword to test instances of class (describe block contains class/object name which is the subject, similar to self)
- single-line Rspec syntax
