## Things learned:

- creating Gemfile with:

```
bundle init
```

- we started off with manually adding gem files - then read up on doing it via bundler
- updating local versions of ruby and gems with rvm & bundler
- Rspec config file - not generated automatically by rspec --init; purpose: ??
- reading & interpreting the rspec stack trace
- attribute readers and instance variables, and initialising new objects in a given state - and writing unit tests to verify it
- using constants in Rspec: accessing by ClassName::CONSTANT_NAME (can be used in string interpolation)
