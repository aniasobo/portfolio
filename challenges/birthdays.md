# Birthday Calendar app

[Birthday Calendar](https://github.com/aniasobo/birthdaycal) is a program that you can load in IRB that allows you to:  

- Store birthdays so you can keep track of them
- See them all at once with names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format
- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays you have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday.

**Birthday Calendar is a TDD skill workshop practical**

### Stuff to add:  

- to handle calendars with no birthdays today, I will add a method that peeks into the calendar and returns true or false before methods born_today and birthday_info can do their work
- ideally would add unique names to different calendars to group people by that would all be searchable by a single method
- writing to a file or database so that the calendars can be stored 

### Concepts practiced:

- [x] TDD
- [x] testing with irb
- [x] matching with regexp
- [x] linting with rubocop
- [x] implicit vs explicit return statements
- [x] handing classes and objects 

### Evidence Gathered:

- [x] I completed the requirements
- [ ] I can explain my TDD approach to a senior or a coach and they give me feedback on it
- [x] For each requirement I have a git commit that shows the tests for the requirement and the corresponding code.
- [x] My code is linted with rubocop
