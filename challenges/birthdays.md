# Birthday Calendar app

Birthday Calendar is a program that you can load in IRB that allows you to:  

- Store birthdays so you can keep track of them
- See them all at once with names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format
- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays you have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday.
