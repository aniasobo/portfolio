# Bookmark Manager challenge - feedback from Rhys


## What went well: 

- You were really supportive and patient in sharing your knowledge of PostgreSQL with me and answering the questions I had about it.
- You make a really great point about us having slightly different approaches to how we work, but like you said we negotiated it well.
- You were supportive when I asked if we could spend a little more time trying to solve the problem before going to the walkthrough.
- I appreciated you being clear in communicating how far you wanted to get through the challenge at the start of the session.
- You were really good when driving - making suggestions to help me navigate while still making me feel involved
- I also enjoyed driving while you navigated - you were patient with me and clear with your instructions.
- You have a smart and methodical approach to debugging - it felt good when we solved it!


## What didn’t go so well

- I can’t think of what to put here either really - it was a shame so much of yesterday was about learning and getting things set up, rather than being able to spend more of the afternoon test driving together!
