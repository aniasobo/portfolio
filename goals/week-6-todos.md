- [x] Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- [ ] Give and receive meaningful code review
- [x] Use the XP values to guide your behaviour
- [x] follow the full developer workflow (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)
- [x] keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features
