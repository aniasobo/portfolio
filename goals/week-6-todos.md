# Week 6 to dos:

## Goals:

**By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:**

- [ ] Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build a web app?


### By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- [ ] Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- [ ] Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- [ ] Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- [ ] Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- [ ] Give and receive meaningful code review
- [ ] Use the XP values to guide your behaviour
- [ ] follow the full developer workflow (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)
- [ ] keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features

## Challenges:

- [ ] MakersBnB - Afternoons - Teams
- [ ] Bowling again - Weekend - Individual
