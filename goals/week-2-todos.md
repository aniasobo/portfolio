# Week 2 to dos:

## Goals

1. I write code that is easy to change  
> Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.  
2. I can test-drive my code  
> Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.  
3. I can build with objects  
> Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.


## By the end be able to:

- [x] Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)  
- [x] Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage  
- [ ] Unit test classes in isolation using mocking  
- [ ] Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)  
- [x] Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Challenges:

## Practicals:

- [ ] OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism)
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Testing OO Relationships
- [ ] Learning by building RSpec
- [ ] Refactoring with OO
- [x] [TDD Practice](https://github.com/makersacademy/birthdays) (from Week 1) - Birthdays app

_list of practicals is in Course - Week outlines.md_

## Projects:

- [ ] Gilded Rose Design Project 

### Personal:
- [x] ask for feedback
- [x] learn how to use feature_spec.rb to automate feature tests (more info in Solution to step 12 of Boris Bikes challenge)
- [x] running tests in isolation using doubles
- [ ] use feature testing appropriately in a program (following the process)
