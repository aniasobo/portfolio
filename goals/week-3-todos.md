# Week 3 to dos:

## Course-goal related:

- [ ] Build a web app

## By the end be able to:

- [ ] Build a simple web app
- [ ] Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- [ ] Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- [ ] Explain the MVC pattern

## Challenges:

- [ ] Battle - Afternoons - Pairing
- [ ] RPS - Weekend - Individual

## Workshops:

- [x] Process workshop
- [ ] Modelling the request/response cycle
- [ ] Debugging 2

## Practicals:

- [x] [Servers](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/servers_and_clients/servers.md)
- [ ] Clients
- [ ] HTTP Servers
- [ ] RESTful APIs

from previous weeks:

- [ ] OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism)
- [ ] Refactoring with OO
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Encapsulation

### Concepts

- The relationship between a client and a server.
- How HTTP is used to send information over the web.
- RESTful APIs.
- The request/response cycle.
- Web templating with HTML/CSS.

### Skills:

- Debugging programs that use multiple languages.
- Using a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
- Structuring the code for apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Tracing data between the browser and server.


### Personal:

- [ ] do the RESTful APIs practical
- [ ] watch Takeaway challenge walkthrough
- [ ] get at least 1 feedback
- [x] look into private methods
- [ ] do the dependency injection practical
- [ ] practice test mocks & stubs
- [ ] complete at least 2 practicals
- [x] attend a process workshop
- [ ] learn about polymorphism

#### for later:

- [ ] practice UML
- [ ] start re-learning JS
- [ ] refactor Birthday app according to coach feedback
- [ ] practice writing better READMEs with added irb run through the app
- [ ] refactor Takeaway challenge [along those guidelines](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/docs/review.md) - separate the Twilio method into class; re-add the Menu class to have a to_s method that displays the menu; look into dotenv gem - why use it?
- [ ] gather evidence of debugging skill - be able to explain your process/approach to a coach; complete a practical + add to portfolio; screen recording of debugging
